# heat

[Heat](https://github.com/rubenpersicot/heat) is an academic project. It is programming assignment of the course "Evolution problems" taught at the [Ecole des Ponts Paristech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/) by [Virginie Galland Ehrlacher](https://team.inria.fr/matherials/team-members/virginie-ehrlacher-galland/) and [Frederic Legoll](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~legoll/).


This course aims at introducing students to the mathematical and numerical study of partial differential equations modeling the evolution across time of a quantity of interest. Evolution problems are presents in a myriad of domains, both in the industry of within academic research, in  physics, chemistry, biology, finance, ect


## Objective
The goal of this project is to implement the [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) (FEM) and the [Proper Orthogonal Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_orthogonal_decomposition) (POD) to study the heat equation.

## Installation
